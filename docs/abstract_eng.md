In recent years, Zero Knowledge proof (ZKP) frameworks have emerged as a cornerstone of cryptographic research, providing unparalleled privacy and security guarantees for a wide range of applications.  Given the increased interest in data-ownership and security, these solutions are becoming more and more widely used, although currently, performant ZKPs are convoluted to design. For this reason, frameworks for high-level languages for generating ZKPs have been proposed. These generally use imperative languages, with very few exceptions. 

At the same time, there has been a resurgence of interest in declarative programming languages in the context of Access Control, Authorization, and general policy enforcement and evaluation. These fields are closely related to privacy, and would greatly benefit from the integration of privacy-preserving techniques. Among these languages, Prolog  - with its inherent expressiveness -  offers a unique opportunity to harness the power of ZKPs within this paradigm.  

There remains a wide gap when it comes to integrating ZKPs with declarative programming languages, especially in contexts requiring rigorous policy enforcement. The core of the problem arises from wanting to utilize the expressive power of languages like Prolog for policy definition, and concurrently desiring the robust privacy guarantees of ZKPs. We aim to answer the pivotal question: How can one seamlessly harness the strengths of Prolog's expressiveness in defining and evaluating policies, while ensuring the forceful privacy protocols of ZKPs?

In this paper, we present a high-level ZK framework tailored to Prolog. By leveraging Prolog's meta-interpretation capabilities, and by constructing an efficient representation of the evaluations, we bridge the gap between expressive policy definition and the robust privacy assurances of ZKPs. Our approach showcases the versatility of Prolog in this domain and provides a foundation for future research into combining declarative languages with cryptographic techniques.

The construction of our framework focuses on being able to hide private input data for a public policy. The architecture employs a novel algorithm that efficiently verifies Prolog proof trees, and introduces a mechanism to generate circuits specific to a Prolog program, ensuring the validity of the proof tree and preserving the privacy of underlying data. 

We present our work by walking through the implementation of our framework over an example financial use-case, specifically privacy-enchanced governmental support allocation for residential energy expenses, which demonstrates the privacy-preserving power of such frameworks, that by evaluating the policy, and presenting a proof, we are able to prove how much support we are entitled to, without revealing the underlying credentials or statistics.

Our approach not only underscores the vast potential of integrating Prolog with ZKPs but also sets the stage for groundbreaking advancements in privacy-preserving policy evaluations. As we venture into an era where data privacy and policy enforcement go hand-in-hand, our framework offers a blueprint for future research, promising wider applications in domains like Self-Sovereign Identities, Constraint Logic Programming, and beyond.
