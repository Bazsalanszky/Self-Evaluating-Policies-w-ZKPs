In recent years, Zero Knowledge proof (ZKP) frameworks have emerged as a cornerstone of cryptographic research, providing unparalleled privacy and security guarantees for a wide range of applications. The evolution and refinement of these technologies have been influenced by rapid advancements and groundbreaking discoveries in the domain. Given the increased interest in data-ownership and security, these solutions are becoming more and more widely used, although currently, performant ZKPs are convoluted to design. For this reason, frameworks for high-level languages for generating ZKPs have been proposed. These generally use imperative languages, with very few exceptions. 

At the same time, there has been a resurgence of interest in declarative programming languages in the context of Access Control, Authorization, and general policy enforcement and evaluation. These fields are closely related to privacy, and would greatly benefit from the integration of privacy-preserving techniques. Among these languages, Prolog  - with its inherent expressiveness -  offers a unique opportunity to harness the power of ZKPs within this paradigm.  

#todo abstract problem statement: What problem do we solve? What specific question do we answer?
There remains a conspicuous gap when it comes to integrating ZKPs with declarative programming languages, especially in contexts requiring rigorous policy enforcement. The crux of the problem arises from the dichotomy of wanting to utilize the expressive power of languages like Prolog for policy definition, and concurrently desiring the robust privacy guarantees of ZKPs. We endeavor to answer the pivotal question: How can one seamlessly harness the strengths of Prolog's expressiveness in defining and evaluating policies, while ensuring the stringent privacy protocols of zero-knowledge proofs?

In this paper, we present a high-level zero-knowledge framework tailored to Prolog. By leveraging Prolog's meta-interpretation capabilities, and by constructing an efficient representation of the evaluations, we bridge the gap between expressive policy definition and the robust privacy assurances of ZKPs. Our approach showcases the versatility of Prolog in this domain and provides a foundation for future research into combining declarative languages with cryptographic techniques.

#todo paragraph clarifying the approach and solution

#todo paragraph mentioning the concrete use case we walk through during our approach, and clarifying why is it an answer to the problem statement. The use case: A prolog policy, which can calculate how much governmental support a consumer should receive based on their consumption through a saving-incetivising support model, and based on their socioeconomic status (eg. disability, family status, income)
During the discussion of our approach, 


We illustrate the efficacy of our approach with a prototype ZKP system implemented over the example use-case, performance analysis of this system, and by presenting potential integration with Constraint Logic Programming (CLP) and possible integrations into other privacy-enchancing systems, such as Self-Sovereign Identities.
