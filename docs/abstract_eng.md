In recent years, Zero Knowledge proof (ZKP) frameworks have emerged as a cornerstone of cryptographic research, providing unparalleled privacy and security guarantees for a wide range of applications. The evolution and refinement of these technologies have been influenced by rapid advancements and groundbreaking discoveries in the domain. Given the increased interest in data-ownership and security, these solutions are becoming more and more widely used, although currently performant ZKPs are convoluted to design. For this reason, frameworks for high-level languages for generating ZKPs have been proposed. These generally use imperative languages, with very few exceptions. 

At the same time, there has been a resurgence of interest in declarative programming languages in the context of Access Control, Admission Control, Authorization, and general policy enforcement and evaluation. These fields are closely related to privacy, and would likely benefit from the integration of privacy-preserving techniques. In particular, Prolog, with its inherent expressiveness, offers a unique opportunity to harness the power of ZKPs within this paradigm.  #todo absztrakt probléma felvetés

In this paper, we present a high-level zero-knowledge framework tailored for Prolog. By leveraging Prolog's meta-interpretation capabilities, and by constructing an efficient representation of the evaluations, we bridge the gap between expressive policy definition and the robust privacy assurances of ZKPs. Our approach showcases the versatility of Prolog in this domain and provides a foundation for future research into combining declarative languages with cryptographic techniques.

We further illustrate the efficacy of our approach with a prototype, performance analysis, and showcasing potential applications in Constraint Logic Programming (CLP) and possible integrations into other privacy-enchancing systems.
