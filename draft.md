# Self-evaluating policies using zero knowledge proofs

## Background

### Prolog

what is prolog? what are declarative languages? How is a prolog query evaluated? How can we prove the evaluation of a prolog query?

### Meta-interpretation

What is interpretation? What is meta-interpretation? How is it related to prolog, why is it a good candidate? How can we construct proof of evaluation using a meta-interpreter?

### Zero knowledge proofs, how do they typically work?

### Zero knowledge frameworks for proving program exectuion, using R1CS

Circuitree -> Bulletproofs -> R1CS -> Circom

### Existing use-cases for ZKPs in SSI and DLT ecosystems

#### Brief introductrion to SSI

#### Brief introduction to DLTs

## Motivation

### Policies over SSI credentials using declarative languages

exisiting: walt.id and OPA

### Self-evaluating policies as security and privacy guarantees

### Privacy preserving policies using ZKPs

## Constructing a proof tree of a prolog evaluation with a public program and private input

Meta-interpreter

limitations, sub language defintion: no cut, no negation

## Efficient representation of prolog proof trees

## Algorithm for verifying a prolog proof tree
